# Blog_Generation
This project uses LLMs to create a blog generation app on streamlit. Use this project to understand the working of LLama2.

This project requires LLama2 model, please download it from the Meta official website to your local host and parse the path for the project to work smoothly.

Note: llms and CTransformers are now accessed through langchain_community module, do install that for avoiding unnecessary hosting errors. There maybe changes in the langchain technology, I strongly suggest to check out the documentation before diving into the project
